## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, Java, basically trying how to make applications and also some HTML stuff.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m not currently looking to collaborate on anything rn, I just want to learn how this stuff works.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am also a euphonium player! I don't know if that helps on GitHub, but I know a thing or two about music.
